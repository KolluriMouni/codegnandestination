            <>
                <p>There are multiple benefits of doing software testing projects for students. One key factor is that you get hands-on practice with the software testing tools and mentor guidance on how to write scripts for the execution of various test cases. Here are a few more reasons for doing software testing projects.</p>
                <p>Understanding of real-world challenges </p>
                <p>Students will understand the potential challenges they can face while executing software testing methods and how to face such situations. You can enrol on a software testing course to learn software testing from senior software testers.</p>

                <p><b>Increase your work pace</b></p>
                <p>When you work on multiple projects, you will gain more experience with manual testing and the use of automated software tools, testing frameworks, programming skills, etc. This will improve your work pace and lead to faster delivery of test reports to the development team.</p>

                <p><b>Enhance professional image</b></p>
                <p>You can add these projects to your resume or share them on professional sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. This increases your chance of meeting potential recruiters. It is hard for freshers to get a high-salary job without work experience, but by showcasing your project work, you can land a good job. Another way of adding projects to your resume without making it look messy is adding your GitHub account link, where you add all your project works. </p>

                <p><b>Improved critical thinking and collaboration skills</b></p>
                <p>While executing these projects, you will face different scenarios. To handle them self-handedly or under expert advice, you need to use your brain, which improves critical thinking skills. Also, you can work in a group or with a software development team that improves your collaboration skills.</p>

                <p><b>Build trust and credibility </b></p>
                <p>If you can share your projectâ€™s details and source code on the internet, people in the same genre will start following you. This will help you build trust and credibility, making individual clients hire you as a freelancer. You can work for such clients to gain professional experience. </p>

                <p><b>Expand professional network </b></p>
                <p>When you work under industry specialists, the chances of getting connected to their professional network are high. They can also recommend you to their connections after carefully watching your skills and expertise for a few months. This increases your chance of landing an internship offer or a job opportunity. </p>
