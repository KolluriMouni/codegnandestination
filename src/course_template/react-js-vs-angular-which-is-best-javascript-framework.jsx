It‚Äôs a quicker experience, which is particularly significant for mobile applications. React‚Äôs tool library permits developers to fabricate components that are dropped onto a website page. \nThese components, which resemble custom HTML components, are what the clients see on the site. Components can be reused across applications and are a lot simpler to refresh and update than looking through lines of code.

                <p>Angular is an all-in-one open-source JavaScript framework that is maintained by Google, to manufacture profoundly responsive single-page applications. Similar to ReactJS, an Angular-based website will see all site changes made in the program. Instead of interacting with a server to stack data, a browser-side experience allows the page to render rapidly with a more mobile-like experience. Angular recently observed the release of its most current version of Angular 9, which is built-on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript.</p>

                <p>Since React is a JavaScript library instead of the full JavaScript framework of Angular, many developers will include more libraries when utilizing React to give it the usefulness of a total framework.</p>

                <p>React, launched by Facebook, in 2013. React is mostly used by the Facebook company in its products like Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. In November 2018, Facebook released the latest version, 16.X.</p>

                <h4> Angular</h4>
                <p>Angular, introduced by Google, released in 2010. Angular is a Typescript-based javascript framework. The next version Angular 2 (dropped the JS from the name- AngularJS), Angular 2+. The latest version is Angular 10, released in June 2020.</p>

                <h4> React vs Angular ‚Äì Popularity</h4>
                <p>The explanation behind the developers why they like React or Angular is that since React includes more Javascript and has an alternate syntax JSX (Javascript XML), it has a stricter setup, architecture, and environment of React. Thus, developers utilize Angular more for this situation. Angular is a well-structured technology with an immense amount of projects and assets.</p>

                <img src="/syllabuspages/prog11.png" alt="error" />
                <p>In Angular, components are known by the name of directives. Angular separates the UI components, as components are in HTML tags and their behavior in Javascript code.  So, it helps in faster angular development services. </p>

                <h4>React:</h4>
                <p>Moderate- React comes with the starting guide, making it easier to start with the react development. But, it does not mean you would not face difficulties learning about the libraries and integrations in React.</p>
