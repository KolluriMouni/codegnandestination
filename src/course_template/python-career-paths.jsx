                <p>Yes, you can change your career from Java to Python. With Java, you already have a good understanding of the core of coding, which is basically the same for any programming language you use. You only need to learn syntax, web frameworks, libraries, and other essential Python concepts. The transition from Java to Python is easier than Python to Java. </p>
