                <p> This common code evolved into a generic web development framework, which was open-sourced as the “Django” project in July 2005 ever since Django has continued to grow and improve.</p>

                <p> The <b> View</b> is the UI — what you find in your program when you visit a website. These are spoken to by HTML/CSS/Javascript records.</p>
                <p> The <b>Controller</b> is the go-between that interfaces the view and model together, implying that it is the one passing data from the model to the view.</p>
                <p> With MVC, your application will rotate around the model—either showing it or controlling it. So a client will enter a URL in their program, that solicitation will experience the web conventions, to your worker, which will call Django. Django will at that point process the given URL path, and in the event that it coordinates a URL way you have unequivocally expressed, it will call the Controller, which will at that point play out a specific activity, for example, get a section from your Model (database) and afterward render a View (i.e., JSON text, HTML/CSS/JavaScript Web page).</p>
