A software tester needs to understand this cycle to plan their work efficiently, allocate resources, and identify potential issues early.  Each of these testing phases requires different skills and knowledge of a tester. For example, during the test planning phase, you need to understand how to create test strategies and estimate resources, while in the test case development phase, the focus is on writing effective test cases and prioritizing them.</p>

                <h2>Which is better, QA or developer?</h2>
                <p>QA is better than developer only if you have the required skills. It is easy to learn, and intensive coding isn’t needed in comparison to developers. However, software testers need to be creative in thinking of possible use cases to test software for end users and have knowledge of all the functionalities of an application or software.</p>

                <p>Yes, software testers are paid well. The <Link to="https://www.ambitionbox.com/profile/software-tester-salary" onClick={() => window.scrollTo({ top: 0 })} className="link-color"> average annual salary of a tester </Link> in India is around ₹4.7 lakhs. However, Experienced software testers with knowledge of automation testing tools and frameworks are paid better. For example, the average annual salary of a <Link to="https://www.ambitionbox.com/profile/qa-lead-salary" onClick={() => window.scrollTo({ top: 0 })} className="link-color"> QA lead </Link>  in India is ₹16.3 lakhs, and <Link to="https://www.ambitionbox.com/profile/qa-manager-salary" onClick={() => window.scrollTo({ top: 0 })} className="link-color"> QA managers</Link> earn ₹18.6 lakhs.</p>

        title: "Will AI replace software testers?",
        intro: () => (
            <>
                <p>No, AI won’t replace software testers but will complete some basic tasks and automate repetitive time-taking testing jobs. They can develop initial code, create test cases, and write documentation. It will only enhance testing accuracy, reduce time and resources, assist with reporting, etc. These tools won’t be able to identify all kinds of bugs in software, make critical judgments, and develop meaningful solutions. Therefore, software testers will be there at least for a few decades now.</p>

                <p>No, it isn’t hard to get a software testing job, especially if you give skills and hands-on training on software and application testing. If enrolling in the <Link to="/job_accelerator_program" onClick={() => window.scrollTo({ top: 0 })} className="link-color">  Job Accelerator Program </Link> of Codegnan, you can immediately launch an internship opportunity or full-time job after course completion. You can also search for entry-level jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed.  </p>
